# Generated Test Images

The PNG files in this directory are produced by `npm run generate:test-images`.

Each image contains:

- A unique colour palette and aspect ratio (landscape, portrait, square, editorial)
- Overlaid labels so screenshots clearly identify the source asset
- Resolution details embedded in the artwork for quick reference

If the files ever go missing, simply rerun the generation script. Do not hand-edit these binariesâ€”changes will be overwritten the next time the script runs.
