## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a photography website visitor, I want to explore the photographer's work chronologically through an intuitive year-based navigation system, where I can first select a year, then browse collections from that year, and finally view individual photographs with minimal visual distractions to focus on the artistic content.

### Acceptance Scenarios

#### Homepage Navigation
1. **Given** I am on the homepage, **When** I view the page, **Then** I see a hero section with site name and geometric camera-inspired design elements on the right, and below it a grid of year boxes displaying available years
2. **Given** I see the year boxes on homepage, **When** I click on any year box, **Then** I navigate to that year's page showing collections from that specific year

#### Year Page Experience
1. **Given** I am on a year page, **When** the page loads, **Then** I see a horizontal layout with geometric patterns on the left and a list of collections from that year on the right
2. **Given** I am viewing collections on a year page, **When** I click on a collection, **Then** I navigate to the collection detail page with proper breadcrumb navigation

#### Collection Detail Experience
1. **Given** I am on a collection detail page, **When** the page loads, **Then** I see a full-width header with collection name on left and geometric pattern on right, followed by a two-column content area with centered photo on left and minimal text description on right
2. **Given** I am viewing a collection with multiple photos, **When** I see the right sidebar, **Then** there is a dot navigation showing one dot per photo, with the current photo's dot highlighted
3. **Given** I see the dot navigation, **When** I click on any dot, **Then** the corresponding photo becomes the active/displayed photo and that dot becomes highlighted

#### Admin Content Management
1. **Given** I am an admin user, **When** I access the admin panel, **Then** I can create new years, add collections to years, upload multiple photos to collections, and set the display order
2. **Given** I am creating a collection, **When** I upload photos, **Then** I can add alt text and captions for each photo and drag to reorder them
3. **Given** I have created content, **When** I set it to published status, **Then** it immediately appears on the public website

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a year has no collections? The year page should show an empty state message
- How does the system handle very tall or very wide photos? Photos should maintain aspect ratio and be properly centered within their container
- What happens when there are many years on the homepage? The year grid should remain scannable and may need responsive behavior for smaller screens
- How does dot navigation work with many photos? Consider grouping or pagination for collections with 20+ photos
