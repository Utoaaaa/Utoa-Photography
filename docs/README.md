# Documentation Directory Overview

This folder now carries only the active reference material needed day-to-day. Historical or planning notes have moved to `docs/archive/`.

## Active references
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` / `ARCHITECTURE_DETAILED.md` – current system diagrams and responsibilities.
- `CODE_STATS.md` – manually curated code/test metrics snapshot (update as needed).
- `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` – deployment checklist and environment requirements.
- `FEATURES_ANALYSIS.md` – living document for feature backlog and discovery notes.
- `LOADER_FINAL.md` – production loader specification that matches the current implementation.
- `admin-workflow.md` – admin CMS usage guide (update the publish section if workflow changes).
- `monitoring.md` – monitoring/observability checklist for the live site.

## Archive
Older summaries, UI planning drafts, and one-off cleanup reports now sit in `docs/archive/`. Keep them for historical context, but feel free to prune further if they are no longer useful.
